# Driver Sleepiness detection using computer vision
## Abstract
Nowadays, road accidents are frequent, and the number of traffic accidents caused by fatigue driving is gradually increasing. In this case, we use Python and learn basic and intermediate techniques from image processing, OpenCV and dlib libraries to implement a program that analyzes the input video stream and concludes whether the car driver is sleepy or is sleeping. By using eye detection, drowsiness detection and eye blink pattern detection with the help of machine vision. To detect fatigue driving, we use cameras that point directly at the driver's face and detect the driver's eye movements. Such a system could help prevent car accidents in cases where the driver is unable to objectively assess his condition. Such systems can help to prevent car accidents in cases when drivers cannot objectively assess their own condition.
